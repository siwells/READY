# READY. 

These are some examples from my fresher's "intro to computing" lecture. My goal is to think small and try to recapture some of the excitement that those of us who were weaned on 80's 8bit machines have about computers and programming.

I chose the name "READY." because this was the prompt that I was most used to. My first machine was a Commodore 64 and I think that that has forever colours my perception of how I think we should interact with computers.




## TODO

1. Add a follow-on talk based on hardware.
2. Bring everything so far together: Emulate a simple computer (QEMU?) with some off the shelf sftware for basic programming.
3. Arduino Uno computer demonstration.
