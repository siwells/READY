This is the site for my annual School of Computing freshers lecture at Edinburgh Napier University.

During the talk I cover the following topics:

    1. My own journey, both in Academia & Computing from the 8-bit days of the C64 to the present day
    2. How computing has developed & the novel challenges that this brings
    3. Having fun with coding, Coding as a way of life, Coding everywhere and anywhere
