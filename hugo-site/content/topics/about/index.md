This site documents an annual lecture that I deliver to the incoming class of freshers in the school of computing at Edinburgh Napier University.

## Who Me?

I'm [Simon Wells](http://www.simonwells.org) and I'm a lecturer in the School of Computing

## The Lecture

In the lecture I try to do a few things:

- Talk about how computing has changed in my lifetime (through some biographical anecdotes and how this has made some things much easier and others more difficult).
- Talk about being the first person in your close family to successfully complete a university course.
- Talk about what it takes to become a decent coder (and suggest some ways to get started).
